## OOP (Object Oriented Programming) Ruby

Object Oriented Programming, often referred to as OOP, is a programming paradigm that was created to deal with the growing complexity of large software systems.

*	Enkaplsulasi is hiding pieces of functionality and making it unavailable to the rest of the code base. It is a form of data protection, so that data cannot be manipulated or changed without obvious intention.
*	Polymorphism is the ability for data to be represented as many different types. "Poly" stands for "many" and "morph" stands for "forms". OOP gives us flexibility in using pre-written code for new purposes.
*	Inheritance
*	Mixin

"In Ruby, everything is an Object!" <br />
Objects are created from classes. Think of classes as molds and objects as the things you produce out of those molds.
example: 
"hello".class
"world".class
use the class instance method to determine what the class is for each object.
