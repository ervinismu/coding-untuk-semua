Example :
  Q : qiven 2 array (sorted+ distinct), find # elements in common

1. LISTEN - 
  Typically: every detail is needed to solve problem, So if you solve a problem 
  without using a detail, you might need that to solve it `optimally`.
2. EXAMPLE -
3. BRUTEFORCE -
   Better to have a brute force than nothing at all. Because
     - Checks that you understand the problem
     - Show you're at least good enough to get that
     - It's a good place to optimize from
4. OPTIMIZE -
5. WALK THROUGH YOUR ALGORITHM -
   Know exacly what you're going to do before coding
     - What variables & datastructures?
     - How, when + why do they change ?
     - What is the structure of your code ?
6. CODE -
   * WHITEBOARD
     - Write straight
     - Use space wisely
       * erase what you don't need
       * okey to use arrows
       * write in top-left corner
   * WHITEBOARD OR COMPUTER
     - Coding style matters
       * Consistent braces
       * Consistent variable naming
       * descriptive variable
     - MODULARIZE(before, not after!)
7. TEST -
  * Analysis
    - Think about each line
    - double check things that look weird risky (for loops that decrement, math, etc)
  * Use Test Cases
    - Small test-cases first
      * you will probably be more through.
      * Faster to run
    - Edge cases
    - Big test cases
  * Remember
    - Think as you test -> don't be a bot
    - Test your code, not your algorithm
    - Think before you fix bugs. Don't panic!
      * wrong fix are worse than no fix.
